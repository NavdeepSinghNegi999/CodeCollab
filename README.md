# Code Collaboration Platform

This project is a real-time collaborative coding platform where multiple users can join a shared code room, write code together, and execute the code on the server. It supports multiple programming languages like JavaScript, Python, Java, and C++. The project uses WebSockets for real-time communication and integrates a code execution service to compile and run the code in the selected language.
